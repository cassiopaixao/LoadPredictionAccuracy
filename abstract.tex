Virtualisation has become a key technology for simplifying resource management and reducing energy costs in large data centres. One of the challenges faced by data centres is to decide when, how, and which virtual machines (VMs) have to be consolidated into a single physical server. Several server consolidation strategies have been proposed and most of them share VM load prediction as a fundamental component. Therefore, a remaining question is to determine how accurate the load prediction needs to be in order to have the benefits of server consolidation.  This paper evaluates X server consolidation strategies and the impact of load prediction accuracy on the number of VM migrations, energy savings, and SLA violations. We performed experiments using Google cluster workloads.  The results indicate that X strategies require an accuracy level of Y\% and the other K strategies require \%A of accuracy.

% IEEEtran.cls defaults to using nonbold math in the Abstract.
% This preserves the distinction between vectors and scalars. However,
% if the conference you are submitting to favors bold math in the abstract,
% then you can use LaTeX's standard command \boldmath at the very start
% of the abstract to achieve this. Many IEEE journals/conferences frown on
